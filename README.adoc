== Name

university-bachelor-semester-project-3 - University Bachelor Semester Project 3

== Synopsis

*cargo run*

== Description

{naho}[NAHO]'s University Bachelor Semester Project 3 (09.2023 â€“ 02.2024).

This high-performance Rust server concurrently handles connections, allowing
clients to exchange messages and modify a shared state. Additionally, clients
are notified of new connections and disconnections.

== Usage

Clients send messages line by line, and may alter the server's shared state.
Actions are checked case-insensitively as follows:

.Message-Based Actions
|===
| Message | Action

| `down` / `s` / `j` | Move the sender down.
| `left` / `a` / `h` | Move the sender to the left.
| `right` / `d` / `l` | Move the sender to the right.
| `up` / `w` / `k` | Move the sender up.
|===

== Examples

To launch the server using {cargo}[`cargo`] with {rust-log}[`info` logging
level], run:

[,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
RUST_LOG=info cargo run
----

Then connect to the server's port using {telnet}[`telnet`] by running:

[,bash]
----
telnet localhost <PORT>
----
